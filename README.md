# Macarrones con tomatico

My wife and I like cooking, but we have descentralization of recipes. I'll try to develop a platform like https://cookpad.com/es in Django + Python + REST, making some improvements in the database to have the possibility to analyze the information.

### Pre requirements 📋

The application contains a virtual environment with the necessary libraries, so you only need PyCharm and Python 3.7.3

You must create a settings.py file because I use a PostgreSQL database and I have excluded the file in the gitignore for having connection data etc.

there is a file that contains the EER diagram of the database [EER_Diagram.png](EER_Diagram.png)

### Testing project ⚙

This projects has some Django Apps, you must add to <strong>settings.py</strong> the following apps:
- receta
- macarrones (To be able to create generic templates and that are accessible from another app)
